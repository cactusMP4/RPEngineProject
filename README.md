RPEngine stands for Rainbow Powered Engine because it sounded fun! ðŸŒˆ

It's being created by following [The Chreno's game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT), but it may have some differences between [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) he made in those series.
For example i am not planing to suport other graphics APIs that are not OpenGL.

I would *really* appreciate if you will contribute.
